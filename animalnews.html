            <h1>Pinellas County Animal Services revokes pet store’s Pet Dealer Permit for animal welfare issues</h1>
                        
<p>Pinellas County Animal Services revoked the Pet Dealer Permit from Blue Sky Puppies after an Animal Control investigation found an overwhelming number of violations of Pinellas County Code regulating pet stores.</p>



<p>On July 9, Pinellas County Animal Services (PCAS) received a complaint alleging that Blue Sky Puppies on Ulmerton Road in Clearwater had sold sick puppies and was keeping animals in unsanitary crowded conditions.</p>



<p>On July 10, PCAS officers arrived at the store to find 177 puppies at the location, kennels with empty water bottles, kennels without a water bottle or bowl available, 34 puppies in kennels that were too small, enclosures housing multiple sick puppies and puppies in the isolation ward too close to healthy puppies.</p>



<p>These conditions were in violation of Pinellas County Code Section 14-29 Retail Pet Store Regulations and Pinellas County Code Section 14-36 Animal Care &amp; Manner of Keeping.</p>



<p>The officers asked for veterinary records for 23 puppies housed in isolation. The store manager explained staff diagnose and begin treatment for the puppies despite staff not holding any veterinary degrees.</p>



<p>When examining treatment sheets in for the medical isolation area, officers found one for a Yorkie puppy showing three days of treatment, but the puppy was not in the store. When asked for the location of the puppy, the staff relayed the puppy had died and was taken to a local veterinary hospital for cremation.</p>



<p>Officers followed up with the veterinary office about the Yorkie and discovered Blue Sky Puppies turned in dozens of deceased puppies for cremation over the last two years. The store failed to notify Pinellas County Animal Services and could not provide veterinary medical records upon request, both of which are required per Pinellas County Code.</p>



<p>The permit holder received a substantial number of citations for<a> violations of Chapter 14</a>, leading PCAS to revoke the store’s Pet Dealer Permit.</p>



<p>“Protecting animals is one of our primary duties, and the practices in use at this store posed a risk to the animals for sale there,” said Jennifer Renner, Pinellas County Animal Services Director. “We inspect and investigate pet stores around the county and will continue to hold them accountable to our ordinance.”</p>



<p>The permit holder can request a review from the county administrator within 5 business days. Blue Sky Puppies previously received one citation for not having Official Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (OCVIs) for five puppies at the store in 2024.</p>



<p>Without a valid Pet Dealer Permit, puppies cannot be housed at the store and must be transported out of Pinellas County within 5 days.</p>



<p>“I am encouraged by the professionalism of our Animal Services staff,” said Board of County Commissioners Chair Brian Scott. “They acted swiftly to investigate a complaint and took prompt action to protect animal welfare in our county. It hurts to learn about potential mistreatment of puppies, but that’s why we have an ordinance regulating pet stores and a trained staff of Animal Control officers to ensure they meet the standard.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can purchasers do?</h2>



<p>If a resident purchased a puppy from a retail pet store, they should have a licensed veterinarian examine the puppy as soon as possible and follow the guidelines in Florida’s Pet Lemon Law. If the puppy is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease within 14 days of purchase or a congenital or hereditary disease within 1 year of purchase, the pet owner has rights and can seek a refund, reimbursement for veterinary fees, or an exchange. They can find more information regarding this law on the <a href="https://fvma.org/tools-resources/fl-pet-lemon-law/">Florida Veterinary Medical Association’s website</a> or contact the Pinellas County Office of Consumer Protection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should people considering pets do?</h2>



<p>Anyone considering adding a pet to their family should do their research. We recommend adopting from a local rescue or Pinellas County Animal Services. If you choose to purchase a puppy, ask the seller for the breeder’s information and request to speak to them directly.&nbsp; Request a copy of all the puppy’s medical records and, if you do purchase a puppy, take them to a licensed veterinarian as soon as possible for a thorough exam.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should concerned residents do?</h2>



<p>If residents have concerns about animal welfare conditions anywhere in the county, they should reach out to Pinellas County Animal Services at (727) 582-2600, option 4 or email: <a href="mailto:PCASEnforcement@pinellas.gov">PCASEnforcement@pinellas.gov</a>.
