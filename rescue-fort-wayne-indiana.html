<h3>Dogfighting is a cruel blood sport and breeds criminal activity</h3>
<p>Dogfighting causes severe and often fatal injuries and egregious suffering. The dogs used in organized dogfighting operations are specifically bred and conditioned for fighting, which is only the beginning of a lifecycle of abuse and mistreatment. Around the world, Humane World for Animals has seen that these cruel events co-occur with other crimes related to weapons, violence, gambling and illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Typical dogfighting injuries include severe bruising, deep puncture wounds and broken bones. Dogs used in these events often die of dehydration, infection, blood loss, exhaustion or shock hours or even days after the fight.</p>
<p>Over the years, law enforcement raids have unearthed many disturbing facets of this illegal practice. Young children are often present at these events, which promotes insensitivity to animal suffering, enthusiasm for violence and disrespect for the law. Illegal gambling is commonplace at dogfights, with wagers of thousands of dollars at stake. This profitability makes dog fighting commonplace in organized crime settings as well as the streets.</p>
